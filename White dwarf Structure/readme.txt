Project using the runge kutta method to work out the Mass-Radius ratio of White dwarf stars.
Involves calculating a graph for the M-R ratio at 2 different values of average electrons per nucleon,
then calculating the approximate mass, radius and electron per nucleon value for 3 different white
dwarf stars.
